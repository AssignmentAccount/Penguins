### Question 1

#### The reproducibility crisis in science and why we should care

The reproducibility crisis is typified by the fact that research across many scientific fields is not actually reproducible by both others and by the researchers who published the work. An article by Monya Baker in nature put together the implications of a short survey of natures researchers. It showed that 70% agreed there was a crisis with 52% believing the crisis was significant. However, when looking at what fields are suffering from a lack of reproducibility, it suggested that biology was among the fields with some of the lowest reproducibility. It is viewed as a crisis due to the fact that confidence in published research is being diminished and as such, It is becoming more difficult to add to the work done by others. These are compounded with a lack of open access and good practices within the methodological process.

There are many reasons for biology to care about this crisis. Having confidence in the research we found our hypotheses upon is very important as making conclusions based on results is already difficult enough. The crisis has also revealed other hurdles in the field such as poor mentor-ship, selective reporting, bad internal replication and unavailability of methods. 
Open science is something that is worth moving towards, and to do so, we must address the lack of reproducibility that is present within the field. The benefits of this shift are outlined within Mckiernan et al’s paper in eLife and present a few compelling reasons. While citation number doesn’t seem to be increased as much for biological sciences when research is open, applied fields greatly benefit from the openness of their research and methodology. Furthermore, open methodologies with clear version control and tracing of changes can better help researchers to constructively critique the work and also increase the opportunity for cooperation. This would lead to a greater number of discoveries and help to reduce the number of dead ends resulting from malpractice or mistakes.

The paper also made cases against the fears of open science. Fear against poor peer review and prestige has been revealed to be mostly unfounded, with some open access services actually having equivalent reputation as those with close access services. In terms of peer review, the open nature of the review process has led some services to have a more stringent and constructive system than those of bigger, closed journals. This builds on the benefits of moving to an open system as it allows the researches to better understand the process behind review and get recorded feedback on the research they publish. By being more reproducible, we are therefore required to be more open as the main hindrance to reproducing research is components of that research being hidden or missing. If we remove this barrier, our research appears to suffer no cost.

Fundamentally, better reproducibility requires and increased effort from researchers collectively and individually. Once implemented, the practice should become easy and habitual and would lead to a better environment that is more conducive and scientific.


### Question 2

#### A poorly represented figure

![](D:/Uni/R Directory/Assignments/penguins/figures/badPlot.png)

The figure breaks quite a few of the general rules of good visual presentation. Firstly, the use of geom_point isn’t the most suitable for this kind of data representation as the independent variable is categorical. A boxplot or bar column would have been better suited to represent and understand what the data implies. Furthermore, the plot is visually unappealing. It has the default theme colouring with no additional colours. It makes it difficult to interpret anything and garner any form of focus or interest. On top of this, using colour and a legend would have shown differences within the groups of interest and not just penguins arbitrarily. The points themselves are incredibly difficult to tell apart as they all intersect one another, again showing that geom_point was not very suitable. The png itself is flawed in the way that it was coded. It was coded with a poor resolution, bad scaling and large size. This means its not actually able to be applied to other forms of media such as a presentation or a poster. An SVG would be far more suitable due to its infinite scalability. Finally, the graph could have been split by penguins for better effect.

### Question 3 

#### The importance of colour choice and what considerations should be made

The choice of colour used within a scientific figure plays an important role not only in the interpretation of the reader but of the researcher making the figure too. The palette that we use can have major effects on the way data is represented and so it is very important that we consider the kind of colour maps we choose to fit to our data. A paper by Crameria et al in nature expresses the importance of this, the theory behind it and the ways in which we can implement it into future research.

Firstly, colour maps can distort our representation of data. If we use rainbow as an example, it can make it difficult to pick out the original image if we apply a rainbow colour map to the image. This means that it is likely having the same effect on the figures that it is applied to.  We can consider maps like these to be unscientific. They are dangerous because they result in a blind interpretation of the data due to the distortion caused by the map. If we don’t know what the “original image” of the data is, then we may assume the one produced with the map is the original image which therefore can misconstrue the implications.

Furthermore, colourmaps can discriminate against people. Poor maps like rainbow are not accessible to people with colour vision deficiencies and therefore blocks out a reasonable fraction of people from accessing a paper and its interpretations. 

Therefore, we must consider the properties of any colourmap that we choose to use. The map must be uniform, without error and have a proportionally linear lightness and brightness. If the map is uniform, we can make use of it like we would a numerical axis with the use of a colour bar. Along with this, ensuing lightness and brightness of the map is both proportional to on another and linear will stop the formation of artificial gradients within the data. This allows for perceptual order to be achieve making the data’s representation inherently understandable. 
It is also wise to consider that inclusion of a colour bar with a gradient is a necessity and not a nicety. Without the bar, it makes it unreasonably difficult to understand what the gradient is supposed to represent and is equivalent to removing the ticks from a numerical axis.

Finally, the type of colour scale we use is of importance when we consider the nature of the data itself. There are different classes of colour maps such as converging/diverging, circular, multisequential and sequential. Using the correct class for the correct data type is a necessity. Editing the map is also unwise as it will edit the linearity of the map.


### Question 4 

#### Statistically analysing the penguins dataset and producing a figure.

The source code, data, functions and outputs are all found within this repository.

### Question 5

#### Reviewing someone elses work

Firstly, the pipeline of their code was kept within a single document with all the other components of the assignment. The code is very brief and mostly self-explanatory. Since it is kept in this fashion, the pipeline is essentially outlined by the order of events. Comments are also added to give context which are helpful but not necessary for me to understand the code. For a beginner or non-coding individual, these comments are very useful, however.

I ran the code with a few minor issues, a result of getting the code to cooperate on my workstation. Once it cooperated, the code worked, and a graph was produced.

I personally dislike that the code is kept within a single R script. This means that it is difficult to decipher what content is responsible for what products. The intuitiveness of the process is therefore lower. A better and more reproducible method would be to functionally program the elements and have them saved in their own function scripts. These can then be sourced into specific R scripts that clean, process and plot the data. Splitting it up in this way not only makes it more understandable as to what goes where and why, but it also increases the ability of the code to be troubleshooted and edited. Clarification of where exactly the working directory is expected to be set would help keep things reproducible as well. 

Since the code is not functionally programmed, altering the code would require me to rewrite a large portion of the code already written. Since the analysis was so simple, it is easy to alter. However, the fact that there is little adherence to the single responsibility principle means that it would become too chaotic and difficult to both understand and reproduce. Keeping things well divided solves this issue and would allow the code to be very accessible to alterations.

#### Reflecting on my own work

My peer commented that I had produced too many scripts and function files and that I should not expect the users of the repo to read my readme to follow the steps of the scripts correctly. I personally disagree with this. The instructions are there for those who don’t have much experience with the code space or work, and so require more instruction. I believe that if someone more experienced is using the code, they will intuitively know the order in which the scripts are to be executed. I do however agree that the natural next step would be the compilation of the source code through a dedicated pipeline, resulting in a final compiled result. However, this is not something I can confidently do at this stage. Further sub-directories in the source directory may have aided this issue. 

I learned that it’s difficult to write code for others when you don’t know exactly who your audience will be. If they vary wildly in capabilities, making it accessible to many people becomes very difficult. In general I found it no different than writing code just for myself however.
